**Subject**: Request for One Day Leave  

Respected Ma'am,  

I, Deepali Rajendra Gobare (PRN: [your PRN number]), kindly request leave for Monday, 16-09-2024, as I have a TCS ION online examination on that day. Therefore, I will not be able to attend classes and kindly ask you to grant me leave for the day.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Deepali Rajendra Gobare
